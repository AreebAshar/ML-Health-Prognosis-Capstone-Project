		<p class="p landingcontent">The experience of a patient visiting the doctor is a multistep process that involves registration at the hospital,
			a physical check-up of a patient's vitals, and a consultation with a physician. Amongst all of these
			steps, the most unpleasant part of the process was shown to be the prolonged waiting times. According
			to the pre-kiosk market survey we conducted of 24 NYU Abu Dhabi students, 82% of participants wished
			to have reduced waiting times during their visit to the clinic. Our project, the Smart Physical Health
			Screening Kiosk, aims to minimize the extended waiting times by automating the process of physical
			examination of a patient's vitals and providing the user with a preview of the possible ailments they
			may be afflicted with. The proposed solution uses a hardware setup of a microcontroller (Raspberry Pi),
			physical sensors, and a touch-friendly kiosk so that users can measure their vital signs and record their
			symptoms. We expect to demonstrate through the proposed system a reduced time consumption which
			results in a more pleasant experience compared to the multi-step process of a patient consultation with
			the doctor.</p>
